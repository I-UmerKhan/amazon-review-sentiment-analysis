# amazon review sentiment analysis

 I completed another NLP project where I conducted sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa product reviews. I began with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), thoroughly analyzing each column of the dataset. Using word clouds, I visually represented the most frequent words in both positive and negative reviews. I then proceeded to train several machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Employing hyperparameter tuning techniques, I optimized these models to achieve enhanced sentiment prediction accuracy.

Additionally, I developed a user interface using Streamlit on PyCharm for this project. The interface streamlined the exploration and visualization of sentiment analysis results from Amazon Alexa reviews, making it more accessible and interactive. This allowed for intuitive navigation through the analysis findings, enhancing the usability and presentation of the project's insights.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of NLP preprocessing techniques, feature extraction from text data, and model evaluation in sentiment analysis tasks. It also strengthened my proficiency in using Python libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn for NLP tasks. Furthermore, I gained insights into the importance of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance.

This experience will significantly benefit my data science career by equipping me with practical skills in handling NLP projects, understanding customer sentiment through data analysis, and effectively deploying machine learning models to derive actionable insights from textual data. These skills are crucial in various domains such as customer analytics, market research, and recommendation systems, enhancing my ability to tackle real-world data challenges effectively.
